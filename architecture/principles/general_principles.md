# General Architecture Principles

## Overview
This document outlines our general architecture principles and best practices. These guidelines help maintain code quality, performance, and maintainability across all projects.

## Core Principles

### Write Only What's Needed (YAGNI)
- Implement features only when they're required
- Avoid speculative functionality
- Focus on current requirements
- Document potential future needs without implementing them

### Avoid Premature Optimization
- Write clear, maintainable code first
- Profile before optimizing
- Optimize only when performance issues are identified
- Document performance requirements and benchmarks

### Keep It Simple (KISS)
- Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Break complex problems into simpler parts
- Document complex decisions and their rationale

### Plan for Extensibility
- Design modules with clear interfaces
- Use dependency injection for flexibility
- Create abstraction layers when appropriate
- Document extension points and patterns

## Code Organization

### Project Structure
```

├── src/                    # Source code
│   ├── core/              # Core business logic
│   ├── interfaces/        # Abstractions/interfaces
│   ├── services/          # Service implementations
│   └── utils/             # Utility functions
├── tests/                 # Test files
│   ├── unit/             # Unit tests
│   ├── integration/      # Integration tests
│   └── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── config/               # Configuration files
└── scripts/              # Build/deployment scripts
```

### Best Practices
1. Group related functionality together
2. Separate concerns appropriately
3. Maintain consistent file naming
4. Keep files focused and manageable

## Design Patterns

### When to Use Patterns
- Solve common problems with proven solutions
- Choose patterns based on specific needs
- Avoid over-architecting with unnecessary patterns
- Document pattern usage and rationale

### Recommended Patterns
1. Repository Pattern
   - For data access abstraction
   - Separates business logic from data access
   - Enables easier testing and maintenance

2. Factory Pattern
   - For complex object creation
   - Centralizes instantiation logic
   - Promotes loose coupling

3. Strategy Pattern
   - For interchangeable algorithms
   - Enables runtime behavior changes
   - Promotes code reuse

4. Observer Pattern
   - For event-driven architectures
   - Reduces coupling between components
   - Enables flexible communication

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
1. God Objects
   - Classes that know/do too much
   - Violates single responsibility
   - Hard to maintain and test

2. Golden Hammer
   - Using familiar solutions for inappropriate problems
   - Forces unnatural implementations
   - Reduces maintainability

## Error Handling

### Principles
1. Be explicit about errors
2. Use appropriate error types
3. Provide meaningful error messages
4. Include relevant context

### Implementation
```python
# Good error handling
from typing import Optional
from .exceptions import UserNotFoundError

class UserService:
    def get_user(self, user_id: str) -> Optional[User]:
        try:
            return self.repository.find_by_id(user_id)
        except DatabaseError as e:
            logger.error(f"Database error retrieving user {user_id}: {e}")
            raise ServiceError(f"Unable to retrieve user: {e}")
        except UserNotFoundError:
            logger.info(f"User not found: {user_id}")
            return None
```

## Testing Architecture

### Test Categories
1. Unit Tests
   - Test individual components
   - Mock dependencies
   - Fast execution

2. Integration Tests
   - Test component interactions
   - Limited mocking
   - Verify integration points

3. End-to-End Tests
   - Test complete workflows
   - Real environment
   - User perspective

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical paths 100% covered
- Document uncovered code
- Regular coverage reviews

## Performance Considerations

### Early Stage
1. Choose appropriate data structures
2. Use efficient algorithms
3. Consider data access patterns
4. Plan for scaling

### Optimization Process
1. Measure current performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Implement targeted improvements
4. Verify improvements
5. Document optimizations

## Security Architecture

### Core Principles
1. Defense in depth
2. Principle of least privilege
3. Secure by default
4. Regular security reviews

### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Security example
from typing import Optional
from .auth import check_permissions, hash_password

class UserManager:
    def update_user(self, user_id: str, data: dict) -> Optional[User]:
        # Check permissions first
        if not check_permissions(current_user, "user.update"):
            raise PermissionError("Insufficient permissions")
            
        # Validate input
        if "password" in data:
            data["password"] = hash_password(data["password"])
            
        # Audit logging
        logger.info(f"User {current_user.id} updating user {user_id}")
        
        return self.repository.update(user_id, data)
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Clear function/method signatures
- Purpose and usage examples
- Important considerations
- Edge cases and limitations

### Architecture Documentation
- System overview
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration points

Example:
```python
def process_order(order_id: str, user_id: str) -> OrderResult:
    """Process a new order for the given user.
    
    Args:
        order_id: Unique identifier for the order
        user_id: ID of the user placing the order
        
    Returns:
        OrderResult containing processing status and details
        
    Raises:
        OrderNotFoundError: If order_id doesn't exist
        InvalidUserError: If user_id is invalid
        
    Example:
        result = process_order("order123", "user456")
        if result.status == OrderStatus.SUCCESS:
            send_confirmation(result.order)
    """
    # Implementation
```
