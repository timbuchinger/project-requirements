# Licensing Guidelines

When creating or managing repositories, choosing the right license is crucial for defining how others can use, modify, and 
distribute your code.

## Recommended Licenses

### MIT License
The MIT License is our preferred choice for open source projects that aim to maximize adoption and usage. This license:

- Allows for unrestricted use, modification, and distribution
- Permits commercial use
- Requires only that the original license and copyright notice be included
- Provides good legal protection for contributors

### GNU GPL License
The GNU General Public License (GPL) is recommended when you want to ensure derivative works remain open source. This license:

- Requires that derivative works also be open source
- Mandates that modifications be released under the same license
- Ensures the code remains freely available
- Promotes open source software development

## When to Choose Each License

Choose the **MIT License** when:
- You want maximum adoption of your code
- You're creating libraries or tools that should be widely usable
- You don't mind if your code is used in proprietary software
- You want to minimize barriers to adoption

Choose the **GNU GPL** when:
- You want to ensure derivatives of your work remain open source
- You're building on existing GPL-licensed code
- You want to prevent proprietary forks of your project
- You're committed to the free software movement

## Applying a License

1. Create a `LICENSE` file in your repository's root directory
2. Copy the full text of your chosen license
3. Update the copyright year and owner(s)
4. Include a license section in your README.md referencing the license type
