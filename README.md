# Project Requirements & Best Practices

A comprehensive collection of development guidelines, architectural patterns, and best practices designed to be integrated with AI coding assistants. This repository serves as a knowledge base to ensure consistent, high-quality software development across projects.

## Purpose

This repository provides standardized guidelines across multiple technology stacks, enabling:
- Consistent development practices
- Architectural principles adherence
- Technology-specific best practices
- Integration with AI coding assistants for automated compliance

## Repository Structure

- `architecture/` - Core architectural principles and patterns
- `guidelines/`
  - `backend/` - Backend development guidelines (Python, Postgres, etc.)
  - `frontend/` - Frontend frameworks best practices (Vue, etc.)
  - `devops/` - DevOps and deployment guidelines
  - `documentation/` - Documentation standards
  - `shell/` - Shell scripting best practices

## AI Assistant Integration

### Using with Cline

Load these guidelines into Cline's memory bank at the start of your project:

1. Copy relevant guidelines to your project's memory-bank directory
2. Cline will automatically enforce these guidelines throughout development
3. Ensures consistent patterns and practices across your codebase

## Benefits

- Standardized development practices
- AI-assisted guideline enforcement
- Reduced technical debt
- Improved code quality and maintainability
- Consistent architectural patterns
